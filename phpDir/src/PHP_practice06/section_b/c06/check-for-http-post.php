/* Write PHP Code here  
Overall idea here is to check if a form has been submitted


Step 1: Use if statement to check $_SERVER superglobal array to see if the key called
REQUEST_METHOD has a value of POST

Step 2: If it does, the search form has to be sent via HTTP POST, 
and a message should be displayed like this:
  "You searched for ..."  (replace ... with term user searched for)

Step 3: Otherwise, simply display the form
