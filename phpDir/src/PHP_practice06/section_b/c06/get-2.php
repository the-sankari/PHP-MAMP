/* Write your code here 
Overall idea here is to use query string to select content

Step 1: Store the value of city in some variable, 
what happens let us say if a key called "city" and its value is not null
Hint: try using nullishing coalescing operator: ??

Step 2: You can check the condition with an if statement. If the value
is a string that is not empty, the PHP interpreter treats that value as true
and runs the code block

Step 3: Store the value of address of the branch in the city 
that was named in the query string

Step 4:  If the value in the city is a blank string it should display
"Please select a city"
